How to create method in java?
===============================================================================================
Types of variables with with respect to scope(coverage, reach, the visibility and accessibility)
    There are three types of variables with respect to scope. local, instance and static variables.
Local variables:
=>local variables are created inside block of codes and they can only be accessed with that block for example
all the variables that we create inside methods, if statements, switch statements, loops etc.
instance variable:
Upside:
1.) Local variables stay shorter in the memory the moment that block of code is done executing, memory
is freed and is available to be re-used.
2.) We can re-use the same name for other variables in other blocks of code.

Downside:
1.) They have limited visibility. They can't be used outside of the block in which they are created.
2.) Initialization is mandatory for local variables, and failure to do so results in a compilation error

Instance variables:
=>instance variables are created outside of any block of code like method, loop, if statement etc. but
they are inside a class.
Upside:
1.) Can be used without initialization
2.) Can be shared between all instance methods of a class

Downside:
1.) They tend to occupy the memory for longer as compared to local variables
2.) They are hard to debug.

Static variables:
=>all the instance variables with static keyword are called static variables.
Upside:
1.) They can be shared across instance statics methods and the instances of a class.
2.) Only one memory location is reserved for static variables even though
we create one million objects of that class.

Downside:
1.) The code can be hard to debug if we don't use the final keyword.
2.) If value is changed anywhere in the code that gets changed for the complete application.

When should we use local variables:
ALWAYS whenever possible.

When should we use instance variables:
1.) If we have to share something in more than 1 instance methods.
2.) When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class and these objects can have different values
for different objects.

When should we use static variables:
1.) When we want to share something globally in all the classes methods blocks of code.
2.) Mostly used to create constants (things that never change)
